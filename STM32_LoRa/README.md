SparkFun RTK Everywhere STM32 LoRa Firmware
===========================================================

This folder contains the firmware that runs on the STM32WLE5CCU6 microcontroller with integrated LoRa radio. Currently, only the SparkFun RTK Torch has this hardware built-in. Therefore, this firmware is only meant for the RTK Torch, and specifically, only loaded on the STM32.

Please see the **[RTK Everywhere Product Manual](https://docs.sparkfun.com/SparkFun_RTK_Everywhere_Firmware/)** for a detailed guide on how to update the firmware on the STM32 within the Torch.
